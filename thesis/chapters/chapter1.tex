In this chapter we will briefly discuss the theoretical background used when dealing with two-component coherently coupled spin mixtures of BECs. Since we are dealing with a many-body quantum problem, the standard approach is to use a quantum field to describe the state of the condensate. This leads directly to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which will be the starting point of this discussion. The following content is mostly based on Ref.\ \cite{lamporesi2023two}.

\section{Gross-Pitaevskii equation}
For a 1D single-component BEC, namely made of only one species of $N$ indistinguishable bosons, one can use a single wavefunction $\psi(x,t)$ to describe its ground state (GS) by exploiting a mean-field approximation, thus revealing the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE):
\begin{equation}
    i\hbar \pdv{\psi(x,t)}{t} = \left[ 
        -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + V(x,t) + g|\psi(x,t)|^2
    \right] \psi(x,t)\, .
\end{equation}
The unusual term in this equation is the one proportional to the square modulus of the wavefunction through the constant $g$, called the \textit{contact interaction constant}, that describes the interactions between bosons. In fact, for an ideal gas of non-interacting bosons, $g = 0$ and one retrieves the standard SchrÃ¶dinger equation, but this situation is not realistic for our purposes. The interaction constant can be written in terms of the boson-boson scattering length $a$, a typical property of elastic collisions, by
\[
    g = \frac{4\pi\hbar^2}{m}a\, ,
\]
with $g > 0$ for a stable BEC (for $g < 0$ the system is unstable and collapses on itself).

The GPE can be written in its stationary form as
\begin{equation}
    \left[ 
        -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + V(x) + g|\psi(x)|^2
    \right] \psi(x) = \mu \psi(x)\, ,
    \label{eq:GPE_stat}
\end{equation}
where $\mu \approx \pdv{E}{N}$ is the chemical potential and accounts for the energy contribution of a single particle. Spatial properties of the condensate can arise from this equation, especially in the case of $N \gg 1$ and when the interaction term is dominating. By neglecting the kinetic energy term from Eq.\ \eqref{eq:GPE_stat}, one easily gets the stationary solution
\[
    |\psi(x)|^2 = n(x) = \frac{\mu - V(x)}{g}\, ,
\]
where $n(x)$ is the density distribution, and the association of the latter with the square modulus of the wavefunction leads to the normalization condition $\int |\psi(x)|^2 \dd x = N$. A relevant case is when the external potential is harmonic, yielding a parabolic distribution
\begin{equation*}
    n(x) = \frac{\mu - \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2x^2}{g} = 0 \qquad
    \Leftrightarrow \qquad
    x = R_{\rm TF} = \sqrt{\frac{2\mu}{m\omega^2}}\, ,
\end{equation*}
with $R_{\rm TF}$ being the Thomas-Fermi radius, a parameter indicating the spatial confinement of the condensate.

Another important property to study is the elementary excitations spectrum due to small perturbations of the GS. It is called the Bogoljubov spectrum and yields
\begin{equation*}
    E(k) = \hbar \omega(k) = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}\left(\frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} + 2mc^2\right)} \approx
    \begin{cases}
        \hbar c k \qquad \text{if} \quad \hbar k \ll mc\\
        \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} \qquad \text{if} \quad \hbar k \gg mc
    \end{cases}\, .
    \label{eq:excit}
\end{equation*}

Also, the healing length is a quantity that expresses how small can spatial changes of the wavefunction be at most. It is
\begin{equation*}
    \xi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{8\pi n a}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2m n g}}\, .
\end{equation*}

\section{Two-component spin mixture}
When the system is composed of two different species ($a$ and $b$), Eq.\ \eqref{eq:GPE_stat} splits into two coupled stationary GPEs:
\begin{align*}
    &\left[ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + V(x) + g_{aa}|\psi_a(x)|^2 + g_{ab}|\psi_b(x)|^2
    \right] \psi_a(x) = \mu_a \psi_a(x)\, , \\
    &\left[ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + V(x) + g_{ab}|\psi_a(x)|^2 + g_{bb}|\psi_b(x)|^2
    \right] \psi_b(x) = \mu_b \psi_b(x)\, .
\end{align*}
This is due to the possibility of collisions not only between bosons $a$-$a$ or $b$-$b$, but also of the type $a$-$b$, thus producing three interaction constants $g_{aa}, g_{bb}, g_{ab}$. Depending on those constants' values, the system can assume different behaviours and GS configurations. 

For example, take the case of a flat box potential in a total fixed volume $V$, yielding constant densities. Letting $n_a = |\psi_a|^2$ and $n_b = |\psi_b|^2$, we can express the energy density in the following way:
\begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{E} = \frac{1}{2}g_a n_a^2 + \frac{1}{2}g_b n_b^2 + g_{ab}n_a n_b - \mu_a n_a - \mu_b n_b\, ,
\end{equation*}
where the first three terms represent the interactions between particles of the same type and between different ones, while the last two terms account for the chemical potentials. Now, we state that the system is thermodynamically stable and miscible if and only if the Hessian of $\mathcal{E}$ with respect to $n_a$ and $n_b$ is positive-definite. The calculation is straight-forward:
\begin{equation*}
    H = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \pdv[2]{\mathcal{E}}{n_a} &  \pdv{\mathcal{E}}{n_a}{n_b} \\
        \pdv{\mathcal{E}}{n_a}{n_b} &  \pdv[2]{\mathcal{E}}{n_b}
    \end{bmatrix} = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        g_a &  g_{ab} \\
        g_{ab} &  g_b
    \end{bmatrix} > 0
    \qquad \Leftrightarrow \qquad
    \begin{cases}
        g_a > 0 \\
        g_b > 0 \\
        g_a g_b > g_{ab}^2
    \end{cases}\, .
\end{equation*}
The first two conditions ensure that neither $a$ nor $b$ collapse, while the latter expresses the condition for miscibility. Intuitively, if $g_{ab}$ is small with respect to the other constants, it means that the two species do not interact much one with the other, thus letting themselves mix and spatially overlap. On the other hand, if $g_{ab}$ is big (and positive), they strongly repulse and undergo a phase separation. From now on, only repulsive interactions will be considered, so the only possibilities will be immiscible or miscible (no collapse).

In the more general case of a non-uniform trapping potential, the densities depend from the position and the distributions are correlated with the interaction constants. Considering the harmonic trap and the miscible case, if $g_a > g_b$ then the species $b$ will be confined in a small central region, while the species $a$ will occupy more space.

The total density profile is drawn in black.} 
    \label{fig:buoy}
\end{figure}
This is shown in the lower section of Fig.\ \ref{fig:buoy}, while the upper section shows the immiscible case and the buoyancy (again, $g_a > g_b$). One notes that the total density profile is not Thomas-Fermi anymore when $g_a \neq g_b$.

It is natural to wonder what the excitation spectrum might look like when two components are present, especially when there is spatial overlap between them. The Bogoljubov spectrum of Eq.\ \eqref{eq:excit} is preserved, but now divided into two energy channels, namely spin and density:
\begin{equation*}
    E_{d,s}(k) = \hbar \omega_{d,s}(k) = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}\left(\frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} + 2mc_{d,s}^2\right)}\, ,
\end{equation*}
with the speeds of sound ($+$ for the density and $-$ for the spin) being
\begin{equation*}
    c_{d,s}^2 = \frac{(g_a n_a + g_b n_b) \pm \sqrt{(g_a n_a - g_b n_b)^2 + 4g_{ab}^2 n_a n_b}}{2m}\, .
\end{equation*}
There are also two distinct healing lengths,
\begin{equation*}
    \xi_{d,s} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}mc_{d,s}}\, .
\end{equation*}

\section{Coherently coupled mixture}
When the system is composed of two species of the same atom, such as two hyperfine states, the dynamics become more interesting because of the possible interconversion processes. One possibility is to use a homogeneous microwave radiation, which couples the two internal states $\ket{a}$ and $\ket{b}$, of the type
\begin{equation*}
    \Omega_R(t) \exp{-i\omega_{\rm cpl}t + \phi}\, ,\qquad
    \omega_{\rm cpl} = \omega_{ab} + \delta\, ,
\end{equation*}
where the coupling frequency $\omega_{\rm cpl}$ differs from the transition frequency between the state $\omega_{ab}$ by a parameter $\delta$ called \textit{detuning}.

\section{False vacuum decay}
Given the asymmetric double well describing the mean-field energy landscape of the condensate (Fig.\ \ref{fig:FVD}), the metastable state A in which all atoms are in the state $\ket{\uparrow}$ is called False Vacuum (FV), since it is not the true ground state.
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/chap1/FVD.png}
    \caption{Mean field energy and bubble formation.}
    \label{fig:FVD}
\end{figure}
The possibility of tunneling to the state B arises from the fact that the bubble formation has an energy cost due to the kinetic contribution of the interaction on the interface (domain wall) between atoms $\ket{\uparrow}$ and $\ket{\downarrow}$. However, when a sufficient number of atoms in the core region flips to $\ket{\downarrow}$, the energy gain compensates the kinetic cost and the tunneling can occur resonantly from A to B. Once happened, the system is not in a metastable state anymore, hence the decaying into C, the True Vacuum (TV), via bubble expansion.\footnote{Note that the TV is not composed of all atoms $\ket{\downarrow}$. This is because while the $\ket{\downarrow}$ state is energetically lower in the high-density core region, the situation is opposite in the low-density tails.}

What is interesting to study is the energy dissipation of the decay during the expansion. The key point is that since the coherent coupling prohibits the system to emit photons, the energy must dissipate through the spin and/or density channel, possibly with waves. Investigating this phenomenon is the purpose of this thesis' data analysis.
